# Players' Value Prediction - EA Sports FC24 (in Ultimate Team Mode)

In the world of virtual football, accurately determining the value of players is crucial for team management and player acquisition in gaming platforms like EA Sports FC24 Ultimate Team Mode. 
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we have delved into the dataset to identify key factors influencing player value. 
Leveraging machine learning models, we aim to predict players' values based on various player attributes such as Reactions, Height and more.

Key Points:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted comprehensive EDA to uncover insights into the dataset, identifying the most valuable players, countries, and teams.
   
2. Feature Selection: Key player attributes such as Reactions, Height, Shot Power, Short Pass, Vision, Ball Control, Long Pass, Age, and Stamina were selected as predictors for the value prediction models.
   
3. Model Training: Utilizing machine learning techniques, we trained predictive models to estimate players' values based on the selected attributes. Models such as Decision Trees, or Elastic Net were employed to achieve accurate predictions.
 
4. Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the trained models was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2) score to ensure reliable predictions.

5. Insights and Recommendations: The final models provide valuable insights into the factors driving player value in EA Sports FC24 Ultimate Team Mode. These insights can inform team management decisions, player acquisitions, and squad building strategies.

Through the combined approach of EDA and machine learning modeling, we have developed robust predictive models capable of estimating players' values in EA Sports FC24 Ultimate Team Mode. By leveraging these models, gamers can make informed decisions regarding player acquisitions and team composition, enhancing their gaming experience and competitiveness in virtual football.
